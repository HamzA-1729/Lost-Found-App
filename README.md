Lost and Found App
Overview
The Lost and Found App is a web application that allows users to report lost and found items, search for items, and view detailed information about the reported items. The app is built using React for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MongoDB as the database to store item data.

Key Features:
Report Lost Items: Users can report lost items by providing details such as name, description, location, category, and an optional image.
Report Found Items: Users can report found items with similar details to help others reclaim their lost belongings.
Search Items: Users can search for lost or found items by name, description, or location.
Filter by Category: Items can be filtered by category (e.g., pets, vehicles, electronics).
Tech Stack

Backend: Spring Boot
Database: MongoDB
Image Upload: Local file system (uploads directory)
Requirements

Frontend (React)
Node.js (version 16 or higher)
npm or yarn for package management
Setup and Installation

1. Clone the Repository
   bash
   Copy code
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lost-and-found-app.git
   cd lost-and-found-app
2. Backend Setup (Spring Boot)
   Step 1: Configure MongoDB
   Make sure MongoDB is running locally or set up a cloud MongoDB instance. Update the application.properties file to configure the MongoDB URI:

properties
Copy code

# src/main/resources/application.properties

spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/lostandfounddb
server.port=8080
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=10MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=10MB
Step 2: Run the Spring Boot Application
Navigate to the backend directory and build/run the Spring Boot application.

bash
Copy code
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
The backend server will run on http://localhost:8080.

3. Frontend Setup (React)
   Step 1: Install Dependencies
   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Step 2: Run the React Development Server
bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000.

4. CORS Configuration
   Ensure that the frontend React app running on localhost:3000 can communicate with the backend API running on localhost:8080. This is handled by the WebConfig class in the backend, which allows CORS requests from localhost:3000.

java
Copy code
// WebConfig.java (backend)
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
        // Allow CORS requests from the frontend (React app running on localhost:3000)
        registry.addMapping("/api/**").allowedOrigins("http://localhost:3000");
    }

}
